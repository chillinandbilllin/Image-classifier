An AI vs Real image classifier based on vgg16 transfer learning [CC IITG] 
The AI image classifier was trained on the CIFAKE dataset, which consists of both fake and real images. The classifier achieved a test accuracy of 89.3% and a training accuracy of 90%. 

The classification report shows that the precision for identifying fake images is 88%, while the recall (true positive rate) is 92%. For real images, the precision is 91% and the recall is 87%. 

The overall accuracy of the classifier on the test set is 89%, and the macro average F1-score is 89%. The weighted average F1-score is also 89%.

Additionally, the classifier achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.9596, indicating a high level of performance in ranking and identifying images correctly.

Overall, this AI image classifier trained on the CIFAKE dataset demonstrates strong performance, accurately distinguishing between fake and real images with high accuracy and precision.
